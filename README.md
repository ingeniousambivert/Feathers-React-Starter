#### Why Ant Design

[**Ant Design**](https://ant.design) is a React UI library that has a plethora of easy-to-use components that are useful for building elegant user interfaces. [Read More](https://hackernoon.com/interesting-javascript-libraries-born-in-china-d50d1bb81355)

#### Why Redux (Toolkit)

- [**Redux**](https://redux.js.org/) is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps you write applications that behave consistently and are easy to test. [Read More](https://blog.logrocket.com/why-use-redux-reasons-with-clear-examples-d21bffd5835/)
- [**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) is the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient _Redux_ development. [Read More](https://medium.com/the-andela-way/why-you-should-use-redux-toolkit-2b73a8e2f75a)
