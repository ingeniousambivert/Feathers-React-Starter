# Feathers-React-Starter

 **MERN Stack** starter template with *Feathers*.

## About

This starter constitutes of [**Feathers**](https://docs.feathersjs.com), [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com), [**React**](https://www.reactjs.org) and [**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/). It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) and [Feathers Generator](https://docs.feathersjs.com/guides/basics/generator.html). The purpose of this project is to provide a starter template for *Feathers-React* Applications. It contains a pre-configured **REST API** with **local authentication** and **authentication management** in the *server* and **state management** in the *client*.

- [**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)  is the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient *Redux* development. [Read More](https://medium.com/the-andela-way/why-you-should-use-redux-toolkit-2b73a8e2f75a)
